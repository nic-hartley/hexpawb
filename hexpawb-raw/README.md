# `hexpawb-raw`

`hexpawb-raw` is a low-level Rust library implementing the HexPawb protocol.

***WARNING***:
You almost certainly want [`hexpawb`](https://crates.io/crates/hexpawb) instead.
You want `-raw` if and only if you need to implement something beyond normal usage.
If you think you need it, please reconsider!

For more details, see [the main repository](https://github.com/nic-hartley/hexpawb).
For protocol details, check [the wiki](https://github.com/nic-hartley/hexpawb/wiki).
